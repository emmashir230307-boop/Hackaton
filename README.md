Our platform is named: 'Help To Go'
We have decided that during war it is extremly important to help people in need, and stay united.
Part of that also means giving a helping hand to others.
Needing help is not something to be ashamed of. 
Don't be scared to ask for something. We want to believe the community will do it's best to help out.
That's why we decided to create a platform where people could volunteer and help others.
We are helping: evicted families because of the war, military service families and lone soldiers.
There are 4 types of possible options: 
Clothes (laundry or fixing and sewing),
Food (a hot meal or for lone soldiers a dinner),
Babysitter,
Private lessons (Math,English,Science).
Each volunteer will have to go through a verification process for them to be able to contribute.
Once there is a match for what a volunteer can do and what someone may need they will get each others contact information
and they can schedual for the best time for them.
This app can help a lot of families and it is easier to manage everything and keep it secure through the app.
We will be happy for everyone to come and volunteer, 
your help is appreciated by the team and those you help.
Thank you<3
