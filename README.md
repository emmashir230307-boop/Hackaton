Our app is named: 'Help To Go'
We have decided it is really important to help people in need in this hard time.
We believe that during war it is extremely important to stay united.
Part of that also means giving a helping hand to others.
We decided to create a platform where people could volunteer and help different types of people.
We are helping: evicted families because of the war, military service families and lone soldiers.
There are 4 types of possible options: 
Clothes (laundry or fixing and sewing),
Food (a hot meal or for lone soldiers a dinner),
Babysitter,
Private lessons (Math,English,Science).
Each volunteer will have to go through a verification process for them to be able to contribute.
Once there is a match for what a volunteer can do and what someone may need they will get each others contact information
and they can schedual for the best time for them.
This app can help a lot of families and it is easier to manage everything and keep it secure through the app.
Thank you<3
